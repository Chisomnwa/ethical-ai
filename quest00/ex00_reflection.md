# Exercise 0: Honest Reflectiom on AI Use

### Objective: Understand your current relationship with AI in coding and learning.

### Write short, honest answers to these questions:

How have you used AI for coding so far?

    So far, I think I have improved on how I use AI for coding. Initially, I wouldn't call myself a good user as I was pratically copying and pasting the code solutions AI would give me, until I realized how it slowly affected my critical thinking. Now, I use AI To help me learn and figure something out. I ask it questions and guidance giving it some hints from my intitial solutions ot try outs. 

Do you usually try problems yourself first
    Yes, I sometimes do, but now I have made a decision to always try the problems myself.

Can you explain code you've submitted without AI's help? 

    Yes, I can explain a code I have submitted without AI but I ned to improve on that.

What would happen if AI was unavailable during an exam or job test?

    Well, I have already started coding before the release of chatgpt and before then, I use online resources like stack overflow, github projects, and medium.com articles to prepare myself for exams or job tests. I did really enjoy it and I still use those resources. So, if AI isn't working right now, I will still be able to get prepared for my exams and job tests.

Identify your current pattern:

    Learner A: uses AI as an answer generator.

    Learner B: uses AI as a learning amplifier.

    My current pattern is using AI as a learning amplifier.

Write a short paragraph describing where you are today and what type of learner you want to become.

    CUrrently, I am someone who uses AI To amplify my learning. When I get stuck on finding a solution to a problem, I ask it questions providing insights on what I have done before, then I ask it for guidance on what to do to move forward. I think that's what it means to use AI To amplify your learning.
