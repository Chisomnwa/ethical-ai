# Exercise 5: Building Irreplaceable Skills

### Objective: Identify the human skills that separate good coders from AI users.

Rate yourself (1–5) in each skill and plan improvements:

Skill | Description | Rating | Improvement Plan
-- | -- | -- | -- 
Problem Decomposition | Breaking down problems logically      | 4/5   | 
Systems Thinking      | 1nderstanding how components interact | 3/5   | 
Critical Evaluation   | Knowing when code is wrong or inefficient | 3/5 |
Debugging Mindset     | Investigating unexpected behavior     | 3/5     |
Conceptual Understanding    | Knowing WHY, not just HOW       | 4/5     |

Choose your lowest-rated skill and write 3 specific actions you'll take this week to improve it without relying on AI.

    My lowest-rated skils and 3 specific actions that I will take this week to improve them are:
    
    1. Systems Thinking: 
        - I will draw simple diagrams (on paper or notes) showing how different parts of my code interact before I start coding, even for small tasks.
        - After finishing an exercise, I will explain out loud (or write a short paragraph) how data flows from input to output and where decisions are made.
        - I will read one small piece of code I wrote previously and rewrite it in my own words, focusing on how each other depends on the others.

    2. Critical EValuation:
        - BEfore accepting my solution as "done", I will manually test it with at least three edge cases and ask myself why it works or fails.
        - I will compare two different solutions to the same problem (my own or from notes) and write it in my own words.
        - I will delebrately look for one weakness or limitation in every solution I write, even if the code already passes.

    3. Debugging Mindset:
        - When my code fails, I will pause and predict what I expect each variable to contain before printing or stepping through it.
        - I will use print statements or a debugger to check values at key points instead of rewriting the code immediately.
        - I will keep a small list of bugs I encounter this week and write what caused them and how I fixed them.
