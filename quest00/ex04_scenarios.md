# Exercise 4: Real-World Scenarios

## Objective: Understand the real risks of over-reliance on AI.

Answer these three scenarios in a short markdown file:

Interview: You're asked to explain a caching system design. What happens if you've always relied on AI to design systems? 

    If I always relied on AI for designing a system, them I wouldn't know anything. I will not know how to think through the processes of designing a system.


Production Bug: At 2 AM, you must debug code generated by AI months ago - but AI is offline. Can you fix it?

    Yes, by the grace of God.


New Technology: A new library is released, and AI hasn't been trained on it yet. How do you learn it?

    I will learn about the library by pouring through the documentation and understanding how to use the library, the syntax and the best implementation.

Reflection: Write one paragraph explaining how using AI fairly today prepares you for real-world challenges like these.

    Okay. Using AI fairly to prepare me for real world changes like this because it helps me speed up my learning.
