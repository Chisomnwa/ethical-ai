# Quest 00 - ethical-ai

This quest forced me to slow down and look honestly at how I use AI while learning to code. Instead of focusing on getting answers quickly, I had to focus on understanding problems, making mistakes, and reflecting on my reasoning before asking for help.

Working through the palindrome problem and its variations showed me how much more confident I feel when I attempt a solution myself first.

One important thing I learned is that AI is most useful after I have struggled with a problem. When I tried to solve the exercises on my own, I noticed gaps in my thinking and assumptions I didn't even realize I was making. Using AI afterward helped me confirm what I got right, pointing out the edge cases I missed, and suggest improvements, but only because I understaood the core logic.

My main insight about using AI ethically as a coder is this: AI should amplify my thinking, not replace it. IF I cannot explain my own code or reason about its behaviour without AI, then I haven't really learned anything. Over-reliance on AI Might feel productive in the short term, but it cretaes long-term weakness in problem solving, debugging, and system design.

Going forward, I plan to apply these principles in future quests by always attempting problems on my own first, even if my solution is incomplete or wrong. I will use AI only after that point, to verify my approach, explore alternatives,, and deepen my understanding. 

MY goal is to become the kind of developer who can think clearly under pressure, explain decisions confidently, and continue learning even when AI is unavailable.
